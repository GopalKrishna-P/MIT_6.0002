## Assignments

All the assignments are in python 3.5 and the following are some required [packages](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/software/) needed.

We can use anaconda in creating a virtual env with all the required packages so that it would cause trouble with existing installs of the same packages. Make sure you have installed latest [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and run the following.

```
$ conda create --name MIT_60002 python=3.5 numpy matplotlib
$ conda activate MIT_60002
```
